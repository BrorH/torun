# torun


## todo:
### making new program in todolist currently crashes main.py when toggled
- haakooto knows why it happens, but not how to fix. Ask for demo
### make torunprograms importable in other torunprograms
- only delete file when box is un-checked
### open terminal on check/uncheck
### unchecking program kills the process
### disco
### solution to tab/whitespace
### add support for more languages (compiling)
### make some program names illegal (main.py)
- alternatively put programs in own dir

## done
- check/uncheck runs program
- check for file format and run appropriately (wider support needed)
- delete file after running
- make usr-name generalised
